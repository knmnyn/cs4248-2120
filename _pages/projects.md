_Credits: Much of the architecture for this course project comes from
Bryan Low (NUS) and Thorsten Joachims (Cornell)_

_Warning_ ⚠️: this section of the website is still undergoing revision for this semester.  Last updated 4 Jan 2022. ⚠️

A key part of the mastery of any skill is practicing it,
outside of the formal algorithmic basis for the
topics.  The **student projects** form an integral part of the assessment.  Student groups should have 4 to 5 group members and will be
partially self-assembled (into groups of size 1 or 2) and then assembled by the teaching staff into final groups with project preferences and expertise distribution.    

Due to the high demand for this course, we have had to make concessions in the scope and variability of the our project component.  The staff will propose a set of suitable datasets for students groups to work with.  

Note that performance on the different macroscopic metrics is not the critical factor in your grade on the project. We primarily evaluate with respect to the (interesting) ideas your team employs to solve the task.  

## Project Structure

You will need to form teams and propose a topic to for your project in
a formal project proposal.  The staff and your peers will give you
feedback.  After the project proposal, you will be assigned a contact
TA that you can use as a resource for questions and advice.

In Weeks 10-11, the staff will meet with all teams for a
mandatory graded consultation.  Your team will need to prepare a short
presentation deck to present to the staff about the progress of your
project.

Detailed grading rubrics for all phases of the project are provided as
part of the project reporting templates provided in class.

The general grading metrics are as follows:

* Originality
* Relevance to course
* Quality of arguments (are claims supported, how convincing are the arguments you bring forward)
* Clarity (how clearly are goals and achievements presented)
* Scope/Size (in proportion to size of group)
* Significance (are the questions you are asking interesting)

<!-- As with supervised machine learning, sometimes it’s easier to learn from
data than from rubrics.  You can get a look at past projects by
looking the previous iterations of
CS3244 projects as housed in SoC's STePS platform, from either
[Semester I, AY 19/20](https://isteps.comp.nus.edu.sg/event/15th-steps/module/CS3244) or
[Semester I, AY 18/19](https://isteps.comp.nus.edu.sg/event/13th-steps/module/CS3244).

We also would like to thank [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/students/) for their continued sponsorship of our course by allowing our course administrators to distribute 10,000 USD worth of AWS credits to project teams that declare that they will be using AWS platform for their course project work.
